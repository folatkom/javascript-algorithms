## General info
This project contains quite simple algorithm tasks which I managed to do during a course 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures' on freecodecamp.org (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).
Tasks are created by freecodecamp.org, as well as most of the tests which I put at the end of the codes. All the solutions are my own work.

## Technologies
Project is created with JavaScript ES6.

## Setup
To run this project, you should have Node.js and npm installed.
